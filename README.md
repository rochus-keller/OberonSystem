## Welcome to the Oberon System running on LuaJIT

This project is a spin-off from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon. It makes use of my Oberon to LuaJIT bytecode compiler. I'm interested in re-using LuaJIT (see http://luajit.org/) as a runtime environment for strictly/statically typed languages. As proof-of-concept I have written a validating Oberon-07 compiler that directly generates LuaJIT bytecode. To test and validate the compiler I have created this version of the Oberon System which runs in the Oberon IDE on the integrated LuaJIT VM using a Qt based backend instead of the original Oberon System inner modules. Note that this is a prototype.

Here is a binary version of the Oberon IDE for Windows: http://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_win32.zip.
Just unpack the ZIP somewhere on your drive and double-click OberonIDE.exe; Qt libraries are included, as well as this version of the Oberon System. To run it, open the project in the IDE using CTRL+O and then press CTRL+R, or right-click to open context menus and select the commands from there.

The implementation is platform independent. It can be built on all platforms where LuaJIT and Qt 5 are available (e.g. Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Raspberry PI, etc.). Here is a binary for macOS: http://software.rochus-keller.ch/OberonIDE_macOS_x64.dmg.

## Issues
I'm aware that there are still issues; e.g. Texts.WriteReal doesn't seem to work, neither System.Copy. You can post an issue or a fix to https://github.com/rochus-keller/OberonSystem/issues.
